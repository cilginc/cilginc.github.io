This is a technical blog post about compression algorithms. Stay tuned to find which is the best algorithm for your needs.

# What is Data Compression?

**Data compression** is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Its goal is to reduce file size for efficient storage, faster transmission, or both.

There are two main categories of compression:

- **Lossless Compression**: Preserves all original data. The decompressed output is bit-for-bit identical to the input. Common algorithms include `DEFLATE` (used in gzip), `bzip2`, `LZMA`, and `Zstandard`.
- **Lossy Compression**: Sacrifices some data accuracy to achieve higher compression ratios. Used for audio, image, and video (e.g., MP3, JPEG, H.264).

Compression algorithms often rely on techniques such as:

- **Entropy encoding** (e.g. Huffman, arithmetic coding)
- **Dictionary-based compression** (e.g. LZ77, LZ78)
- **Prediction models and context modeling** (used in modern compressors like Zstandard or paq8)

The effectiveness of compression depends on data type, redundancy level, and the algorithmâ€™s design trade-offs between speed, memory usage, and compression ratio.

# Testing the Algorithms

I tested these algorithms on this blog post:

- gzip
- bzip2
- xz
- zstd
- lz4
- brotli
- lzma (7zip)
- zip

Here's the all versions I tested:

```text
gzip 1.14-modified
bzip2, a block-sorting file compressor.  Version 1.0.8, 13-Jul-2019.
xz (XZ Utils) 5.8.1
*** Zstandard CLI (64-bit) v1.5.7, by Yann Collet ***
*** lz4 v1.10.0 64-bit multithread, by Yann Collet ***
brotli 1.1.0
liblzma 5.8.1
This is Zip 3.0 (July 5th 2008), by Info-ZIP.
```

## Files I tested

### FLAC Songs

I used 3 albums from my library. Even thought FLAC's are compressed we can try to compress them even more with these algorithms.
I needed to make the 3 albums on the same file for algorithms to work.

Tools I used:

```text
tar (GNU tar) 1.35
```

- File Size: 3.6 GB

![Desktop View](/assets/img/2025-06-21-Ultimate_Compression_Algorithms_Tier_List/photo12.png){: width="700" height="500" }

And as you can see from the graphs we can't compress FLAC more with these algorithms. Just never try to compress FLAC's like me or you will end up with waste of time.

# Last Thoughts

These been a great experiment for me. I think using zip on linux is not a good solution because gzip is better and open source.
